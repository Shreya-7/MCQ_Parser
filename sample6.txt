QUESTION 1:
During constructor overloading, which of the following should be used in a parameterized
constructor to call the default constructor?
a. The parameterized constructor should be declared final in order for it to call the default
constructor.
b. The this() reference should be used as the first statement inside the parameterized
constructor.
c. The this() reference should be used anywhere inside the parameterized constructor.
d. It is not possible to implicitly call the default constructor from parameterized
constructor.
Correct Answer: b
Detailed Solution:
The this() reference should be used as the first statement inside the parameterized constructor
in order to redirect

QUESTION 2:
Which of the following is an invalid method overloading?
a. static double add(int a, double b){return a*b;}
static double add(double a, int b){return a*b;}
b. static int add(int a, int b){return a*b;}
static int add(int a, int b, int c){return a*b*c;}
c. static int add(int a, int b){return a*b;}
static double add(int a, int b, double c){return a*b*c;}
d. static int add(int a,int b){return a*b;}
static double add(int a,int b){return a*b;}



Correct Answer: d
Detailed Solution:
In Java, method overloading is not possible by changing only the return type of the method. It is
ambiguous because multiple methods having same parameter signature may execute together.
So, changing the return type along with parameter signature will ensure unambiguous
execution of the code.

QUESTION 3:
Which of the following is/are TRUE regarding the string array provided as a parameter to
the main method in Java?
a. It can be used to get command line arguments from the user.
b. It is mandatory to name the string array as ‘args’.
c. Accessibility of the values provided as command line argument is restricted only to the
main method.
d. Only one command line argument input is allowed at a time.
Correct Answer: a
Detailed Solution:
In Java, the function of the string array provided in the main method is to get the command line
arguments provided by the user during the execution of the program. This is just like any other
string array and hence, its name can be set anything. Since, the command line values are
passed to the main method, this can be used anywhere in the program. Users are allowed to
put multiple command line arguments one after another using spaces in between.
